The Thank You Token is a concept I came up with to tackle two problems that I was experiencing: first, the difficulties I have with expressing my gratitude to the people that matter to me, and second, the vast amount of resources put into and environmental impact caused by the widespread practice of gift-giving at every other occasion, despite many such gifts being unwanted or impractical.

## The Concept

The Thank You Token is even simpler: it could be anything really, something small you have lying around that you can transform into a gift, the point being that it is not about the intrinsic value it carries, but the sentimental value bestowed upon it by the mere act of giving it. To make it more recognizable, you can draw or paint the Thank You Token logo on it. After a meaningful interaction with someone, be it a dinner date or a meet-up with an old friend, the Thank You Token is a way of saying thanks.

Additionally, it is intended as a circular gift, as you are supposed to pass it on to someone else after receiving it, whenever you're having a new meaningful interaction. This way, the token can travel around the world, connecting people in a way that is sustainable and meaningful.

## The Project

To help people get started, I created a [website](https://thank-you-token.nl "Thank You Token Website") explaining the concept, as well as a [web app](https://app.thank-you-token.nl "Thank You Token App") where users can keep a picture of the tokens they have received along with the story behind it. This way, whenever you pass it on, you will still have the entry in the app to reminisce about the interactions.

The website also links to a flyer that provides more information about the Thank You Token concept, which can be printed and gifted along with the token.

It was a fun project that required me to work with a variety of tools: I made the website with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), the app with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), using Google Drive as the place to store tokens, and the flyer using [Adobe InDesign](https://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html). Feel free to check it out, make a token yourself, and give it to someone you care about :)
