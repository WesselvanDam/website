With a camera in hand, I look at the world quite differently. While photography is far from being my main hobby, I do enjoy capturing impressive architecture, colorful plants, and beautiful landscapes. I've never really researched the science behind photography, and my work could benefit from a slightly better camera, but occasionally some pictures turn out quite well. In fact, some of my favourites are taken with my phone.

Occassionally, I edit photos using Adobe Lightroom. The original lighting doesn't always yield the result I am aiming for, which may be due to my placid disposition. Instead, I prefer vibrant colors that some may consider too artificial. Nevertheless, below you can find some of my favorite shots &mdash; click on any of them to view it in high resolution. I'll add some more recent ones soon!
