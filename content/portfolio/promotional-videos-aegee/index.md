During my [board year at AEGEE-Leiden](/career/board-year-at-aegee/), I spent some time during the COVID-19 pandemic creating promotional videos for the association. Together with renewing the website, this was part of our effort to improve the online presence of the association. Throughout my years as a student, I had already gained some experience with video editing for various projects using Adobe Premiere Pro and sometimes Adobe After Effects. I was happy to put these skills to use for AEGEE, and in this post I will share some of the public videos I made.

## AEGEE-Leiden Introduction

This short video is intended to give a quick overview of what AEGEE is about, with short shots and flashy transitions, primarily using footage that was already available. It was challenging to incorporate all the different aspects of AEGEE-Leiden in such a short video, but I think it turned out well. I made an effort to time the transitions to the music, an effect that I always enjoy in videos. I also did the voice-over, although I think I distorted my voice a bit too much.

## Meet the members

In this video, we wanted to explain what AEGEE-Leiden is about from the perspective of its members, taking some more time show what the association has to offer. It involved a bit more planning and writing, as well as shooting new footage interviewing members. A big challenge was to get the audio quality consistent, as we were shooting in different locations without professional equipment. 

## Summer trip 2022 aftermovie

This one I made two years after my board term, but I still wanted to share it here. It is an aftermovie of the summer trip that AEGEE-Leiden organized in 2022. We went to the Baltic States, and since we had quite a lot of footage, I decided to make this video. Here, too, I tried to time the transitions to the music. It's a simple video, but I think it captures the atmosphere of the trip well.
