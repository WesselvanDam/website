It is a concept I came up with to tackle two problems that I was experiencing: first, the difficulties I am having personally with expressing my gratitude to the people that matter to me, and second, the vast amount of resources put into and environmental impact caused by the widespread practice of gift-giving at every other occasion, despite many such gifts being unwanted or impractical.

# The Concept
The Thank You Token is even simpler: it could be anything really, something small you have lying around that you can transform into a gift, the point being that it is not about the intrinsic value it carries, but the sentimental value bestowed upon it by the mere act of giving it. After a meaningful interaction with someone, be it a dinner date or a meet-up with an old friend, the Thank You Token is a way of saying thanks.

# The Project
To help people get started, I created a [website](https://thank-you-token.nl "Thank You Token Website") explaining the concept, as well as a [web app](https://app.thank-you-token.nl "Thank You Token App") where users can keep a picture of the tokens they have received along with the story behind it. It was a fun project that required me to work with a variety of tools. Feel free to check it out, make a token yourself, and give it to someone you care about :)
