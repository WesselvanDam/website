As an extra-curricular addition to my [bachelor's degree](/about/bachelor), I enrolled in the Honours College track [Bèta and Life Science](https://www.student.universiteitleiden.nl/vr/honoursonderwijs/honours-college/facultaire-trajecten/beta-and-life-science "Bèta and Life Science track information"). The Honours College entails a 30 credit programme with lots of elective space that serves as an extra challenge next to one's major. For me, it was an opportunity to dive into interests that were not covered in my astronomy major.

# Why the Honours College?
Participating in the Honours College was a way to have an extra challenge next to completing my regular courses. Initially, I planned to get both an astronomy degree and a physics degree, but I quickly abandoned this idea as the physics-only courses did not seem as interesting. With the Honours College, there was a lot of freedom to choose courses to my liking.

# My experience
Among those courses are some that revolve around personal development, writing fiction, effective management, and a course on didactics involving a small project at a high school. Despite being relatively short excursions into those topics, they were interesting and fun, with often different modes of teaching and assessment compared to what I was used to. Besides, other students in those courses often came from a wide variety of study backgrounds, which turned out to be inspiring and enlightening as well.

The Honours College also provided some job opportunities for me, as I first became the [student ambassador of the track](/about/student-ambassador-honours-college) and later the [Honours Academy Assessor](/about/assessor-honours-academy).
