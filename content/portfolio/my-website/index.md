The website you're on right now has a long history. While I have a different post dedicated to the [purpose of my website](/thoughts/this-website/), this post is more about the process of building it, which took longer than I anticipated. While it may not look like much to some, a lot of thinking and some failed attempts preceded this, which has been both frustrating and insightful. 

I'm not entirely sure when I decided that I wanted my own website, but I started working on it somewhere during my [exchange in Stockholm](/career/exchange-in-stockholm). I was heavily inspired by [GatesNotes](https://www.gatesnotes.com/), the website of philanthropist Bill Gates, and the type of content that was on there. I was also obsessed with the idea of making my site hyper-symmetrical. My website's _tagline_ had to consist of three items, because the content was split into a _blog_ part consisting of three categories (_Thoughts_, _Stories_, and _Content_) and an _about_ part consisting of three categories (_Portfolio_, _Experience_, and _Education_).[^1] Here's a little video showing the version I made at the time using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/ "The Svelte website"):

It was my first true experience building a website (not counting the web version of the [AEGEE-Leiden App](/portfolio/aegee-leiden-app)), as well as my first experience with Svelte. Although I liked the animations and transitions, I wasn't happy with a lot of things, and didn't give the project much thought once I started my internship and wrote my thesis for my [master's degree](/career/master-computer-science).

Although continuing this project was on my mind occasionally, I only really started working on it again after finishing the [Thank You Token Project](/portfolio/thank-you-token). Where I initially had chosen Svelte to expand my skillset, I now chose to start over in Flutter as it was the framework I was most confident with and I didn't want the technical side of the project to slow me down. Inspired by my work on the [AEGEE-Leiden website](/portfolio/aegee-leiden-website), I started making some designs in Figma first, as opposed to diving into the code right away.

[^1]: At the beginning of the video of my first website, you'll see that the three items in the tagline are _Stoic | Generalist | Introvert_. Indeed, quite dramatic, and at the time I was rather pleased with these three. Soon, however, I started to dislike the idea of trying to describe myself in three words (as well as these three specifically). Now, I prefer the idea of the ensemble of posts on this website describing me instead.
