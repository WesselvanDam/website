My biggest coding project to date surely is the development of the AEGEE-Leiden App, a mobile app for both iOS and Android made with the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) framework. This project started in September 2020, and we released the first version on May 24, 2022. Since then, regular updates are released with bug fixes and new features.
