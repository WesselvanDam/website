My first job as a student was a small position as the student ambassador of the Astronomy bachelor's degree. Student ambassadors represent a programme at the university's Open Days, Student for a Day events and other activities to inform prospective students about the degree and student life.

While I wanted to find a small job in Leiden — as I was moving there in the summer of 2018 — I knew that I would not have too much spare time, as my [bachelor's degree](/education/bachelor-astronomy) combined with the [Honours College program](/education/honours-college) would have me follow 82 credits worth of courses (as opposed to 60). Nevertheless, I really liked everything this job entailed, from showing high school students around on campus to giving a presentation about the degree in front of 280 visitors of the university's Open Day. 

I found that this type of work suits me quite well, which resulted me in both becoming the [student ambassador](/experience/student-ambassador-honours-college) of my Honours College track, as well as the [Internal Affairs Officer](/experience/board-year-at-aegee) of my student association.
