I often get a lot of energy out of optimising tasks or fixing problems using some sort of technology. I will just look around for something that could be improved and then try to find a way to do so. Sometimes, however, I'll be captivated by an idea that is not necessarily useful. One such idea was to create animated versions of some icons that I had designed for my student association, AEGEE-Leiden. It was a great way to learn more about Adobe After Effects and animation in general &mdash; not that I needed that experience for anything in particular.

## Some context: AEGEE's Visual Identity
Some time before this project, I had set up a [visual identity for AEGEE-Leiden](https://www.vi.aegee-leiden.nl/ "AEGEE-Leiden's Visual Identity"), together with fellow AEGEE member [Iris Molenaar](https://www.irismolenaar.com/home). The primary goal was to update templates for documents and presentations, but along the ride we also created a set of icons for committees as well as for the five 'themes' that I had more or less invented to describe the different aspects of AEGEE-Leiden. These icons were primarily used on [AEGEE's Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aegee_leiden/ "AEGEE-Leiden's Instagram"), both for posts and highlights. More recently, these icons (but more importantly, the themes they represent) have also been featured on the [updated website](/portfolio/aegee-leiden-website/ "My work on AEGEE-Leiden's website").

In-between these two projects, when I was in the first year of my master's degree, I took on the challenge of animating these icons. The only direct use case for such animations would be in some promotional videos or aftermovies, but there weren't any plans for such videos at the time. Nevertheless, I liked the idea of honing my skills in Adobe After Effects.
