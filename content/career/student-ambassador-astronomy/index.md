My first job as a student was a small position as the student ambassador of the Astronomy bachelor's degree. Student ambassadors represent a programme at the university's Open Days, Student for a Day events and other activities to inform prospective students about the degree and student life.

While I wanted to find a small job in Leiden &mdash; as I was moving there in the summer of 2018 &mdash; I knew that I would not have too much spare time, as my [bachelor's degree](/career/bachelor-astronomy) combined with the [Honours College program](/career/honours-college) would have me follow 82 credits worth of courses (as opposed to 60). Nevertheless, I really liked everything this job entailed, from showing high school students around on campus to giving a presentation about the degree in front of 280 visitors at the university's Open Day. 

I found that this type of work suits me quite well, which resulted me in both becoming the [student ambassador](/career/student-ambassador-honours-college) of my Honours College track, as well as the [Internal Affairs Officer](/career/board-year-at-aegee) of my student association. All these positions entail, to some degree, showing people what opportunities are available to them and how they can make the most of their time &mdash; something I find very rewarding.
