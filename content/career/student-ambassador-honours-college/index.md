In the third year of my bachelor's degree, after almost having completed my own [Honours College track](/education/honours-college), I found myself on the other end of the programme as the student ambassador. There, I recruited new honours students and helped organise educational and social activities. I also helped migrate the programme's online materials to the learning environment BrightSpace.

While still a relatively small job, I really liked the work environment, as it was really nice working together with the track's coordinator [Mionne Laman](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/mionne-laman) as well as other students involved in recruiting new first-years. It was also exciting to show up to lectures of first-year courses to promote the programme in front of packed lecture halls.

After two years, I had to say goodbye as I was no longer a bachelor student, but I continued my involvement with Honours education as the [Assessor of the Honours Academy](/experience/assessor-honours-academy), the institute that oversees all Honours education at Leiden University.
